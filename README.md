SDK to allow you to use the legacy Litmus Reseller SOAP API.
You can retrieve all available clients, create a test and get the results.

**April 2021**: [Phlib](https://github.com/phlib) have taken over the
maintenance of this package from [blaugueux](https://github.com/blaugueux).
Huge thanks for trusting us to continue his work! We've been using this
package for years in our commercial projects, so we're looking forward to
keeping it going!

Thankfully, Litmus have
[archived the documentation](https://litmus.github.io/legacy-litmus-api-docs/)
for this legacy API.

Litmus deprecated this API in 2015.
New implementations should use their current APIs, listed at [docs.litmus.com](https://docs.litmus.com).
